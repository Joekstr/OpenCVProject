A game of Where's Waldo, run by OpenCV!

Let's play Where's Waldo!
1. Load a Where's Waldo image.
2. Load a picture of Waldo.
3. Track wherever the user clicked.
4. Draw a mask over the image, showing only an area around where the player clicked.
5. Use OpenCV to see if Waldo is within the area that the user clicked.
  a. If not, allow them to retry.
  b. If so, highlight Waldo and congratulate the player!
